Python Analysis — Working Set & Reuse Distance
=============================================

This folder contains exploratory analysis scripts for traces generated by the simulators. The two main scripts are:

- `working_set.py` — computes working-set size over sliding windows and recommends cache sizes for target hit rates.
- `reuse_distance.py` — computes reuse-distance (stack distance) distribution and predicts hit rates for various cache sizes.

Requirements
------------
Use the virtual environment in the repository (or create a new one) and install requirements:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How to run
----------
Both scripts have a small example generator that runs without input files. To run:

```sh
python working_set.py
python reuse_distance.py
```

Both scripts print summary statistics and save PNG plots (`working_set_analysis.png`, `reuse_distance_analysis.png`) in the working directory.

Making the scripts point to real traces
--------------------------------------
If you have a trace file (one 64-bit address per line), modify the script or add a CLI argument parsing to supply the trace file path and optionally the block size, window sizes, or output path.

Suggested improvements
---------------------
- Add `argparse` for CLI usage (input trace path, block size, window sizes, output dir).
- Add small unit tests for the distance computations.
- Add a `tests/` folder with example trace fixtures.
